## Unconfirmed Bitcoin Transaction Adjustment Tool

#### About
- What can this tool do?

 * It allows to adjust unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions.

- How can it help me?
 * In a situation where you accidentally sent your bitcoins to a wrong address. Using this tool you can generate a new transaction with different output address and higher fee. As a result you will be able to outpace the old transaction.

- What fee should I set?
 * It definitely must be higher than the old one and the higher, the better. By default is it set to x5.

- Can I trust this service?
 * Don't trust. Verify. This tool works on pure JavaScript and is running on your computer. You sign the transaction yourself, so this tool doesn't have access to your private keys. Moreover, the source code is open and can be found here: github.com/pyzhyk/btc-tx-adjustment-tool
